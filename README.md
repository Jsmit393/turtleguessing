# Turtle Guessing Game

## Description
This project is a Java-based turtle guessing game where users have to guess the x and y coordinates of a hidden turtle in a 500x500 grid. The program provides feedback based on whether the guess is too high or too low, and it draws lines across the grid to help guide the user.

## Features
- Random x and y coordinates generation for the turtle.
- User interaction to input guesses.
- Visual representation of feedback with grid lines.
- Turtle becomes visible once the correct coordinates are guessed.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- Any IDE or command-line tool to compile and run Java programs.

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Compile the Java file:
    ```bash
    javac ITSC1212Lab8.java
    ```
3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    java ITSC1212Lab8
    ```
4. Enter guesses for the x and y coordinates to find the hidden turtle.

## Usage
- The program will generate random coordinates for the turtle's position and ask the user to guess the x and y coordinates.
- After each guess, feedback is provided, and visual lines are drawn to guide the user.
- The turtle becomes visible once the correct coordinates are guessed.
